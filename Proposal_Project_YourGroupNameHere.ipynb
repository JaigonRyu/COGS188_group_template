    "\n",
    "You have the choice of doing either (1) an AI solve a problem style project or (2) run a Special Topics class on a topic of your choice.  If you want to do (2) you should fill out the _other_ proposal for that. This is the proposal description for (1).\n",
    "\n",
    "You will design and execute a machine learning project. There are a few constraints on the nature of the allowed project. \n",
    "- The problem addressed will not be a \"toy problem\" or \"common training students problem\" like 8-Queens or a small Traveling Salesman Problem or similar\n",
    "- If its the kind of problem (e.g., RL) that interacts with a simulator or live task, then the problem will have a reasonably complex action space. For instance, a wupus world kind of thing with a 9x9 grid is definitely too small.  A simulated mountain car with a less complex 2-d road and simplified dynamics seems like a fairly low achievement level.  A more complex 3-d mountain car simulation with large extent and realistic dynamics, sure sounds great!\n",
    "- If its the kind of problem that uses a dataset, then the dataset will have >1k observations and >5 variables. I'd prefer more like >10k observations and >10 variables. A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better. The goal of training an unsupervised machine learning model is to learn the underlying pattern in a dataset in order to generalize well to unseen data, so choosing a large dataset is very important.\n",
    "- The project must include some elements we talked about in the course\n",
    "- The project will include a model selection and/or feature selection component where you will be looking for the best setup to maximize the performance of your AI system. Generally RL tasks may require a huge amount of training, so extensive grid search is unlikely to be possible. However expoloring a few reasonable hyper-parameters may still be possible. \n",
    "- You will evaluate the performance of your AI system using more than one appropriate metric\n",
    "- You will be writing a report describing and discussing these accomplishments\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to delete this description section when you hand in your proposal."

    "Explorign the gaming world using AI is a subject that has been investigated for years. With the expansion of AI in gaming, there have been numerous uses for AI in gaming, and in other industries. Though classic games such as Super Mario Bros may seem intutive to play, or simple enought with only 6 inputs, there are over 16 different inputs, and different varibales like obstacles, enemies, power up, lives, and timers. By showing that AI is capable of performing so many differnt tasks at once is a great way to show that AI is a reliable method to navigate dynamic enviroemtns. \n",

Using these papers as a benchmark on our own agent, we will also utilze similar model adn a similar approach.

We will utilize thier result, however, in regardss to the mario paper, to compare our model with outside resources.\n",
