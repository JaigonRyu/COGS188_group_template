So use the method that works for you, but do use inline citations.\n",

    "# Data\n",
    "\n",
    "For our data set we will be using a package called `gym_super_mario_bros` that uses `nes-py` as its base rom to run Super Mario Bros. \n",

    "## Data Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "### State Space Creation\n",
    "\n",
    "For our data we took in pixel frames of the games to represent states. However, the orginal size of the frames were too large to compute effeciently. To fix this we used gyms wrappers and a custom SkipFrame wrapper to preprocess after creating the envriorment. The following wrappers were applied:\n",
    "\n",
    "- SkipFrame\n",
    "    - SkipFrame allows use to use an action for one frame and apply it to as many as we specify in the parameter. We decided to skip four frames saving us from redundancy. Rewards from the skipped states are added and we return the cumulative reward and the most recent step info. \n",
    "\n",
    "- ResizeObservation\n",
    "    - This wrapper simply allows us to resize each frame from the original RGB input shape of (240, 256, 3) to the shape (84, 84, 3). This will help reduce computational costs later on with our neural networks. \n",
    "\n",
    "- GrayScaleObservation\n",
    "    - Gray scaling our images does a similar thing by reducing the shape of our yet again. This time it will reduce the three RGB channels to one grayscale channel making our frame shape now (84, 84, 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "- FrameStack\n",
    "    - Fraem stacking helps our network see \"motion\" better. To do this we will stack four consecutive frames on top of each other making our new shape (4, 84, 84, 1). It is importatn to note that our origianl skip frame means that each new frame state represents 16 actual game frames due to the effect of both skipping and stacking frames.\n",
